# MitOfFury

You're resting peacefully in your bed one night, your paw dangling over the edge of your bed. While you sleep, a small, green vortex appears in the floor of your bedroom just below your unaware hand. Suddenly! A massive burst of green light eminates from the vortex and a whirlind of chaos absorbs your room! You awaken, startled, and unable to pull your hand out of the vortex! The chaos subsides, and you notice your hand has now been turned into a massive mit! You make your way outside and see that your city has been taken over by alien whales. Your only chance of survival is to get to the other side of the city and locate the magic cube that will send the whales back to where they came from! Along the way, collect gold dropped by the whales and destroy them with your now mutated hand.

Game Features:
-You're a fox!
-A weird mit-like hand to attack enemy whales (Press Z)
-Coins to collect
-Side to side, up and down movement (I was trying to simulate 2D in 3D)
-Sideview camera follow

Sidenotes:
-Stop moving before you attack, otherwise you might lose the mit.
-The background story worked for me on Unity, but skipped the middle images when I uploaded it to itch.io

Future development:
-Add ladders to caves
-Allow for enemy movement (issues with NavMesh- said it would take like, 30 hours to complete. Weird. Sorry.)
